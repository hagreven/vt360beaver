The project "Beaver Ecosystem HertaflieÃŸ" aims to provide a 360Â° virtual tour with immersive audio experience that takes you on a journey through the HertaflieÃŸ area, focusing on the fascinating ecosystem created by beavers.

## About
Beavers are incredible ecosystem engineers, capable of transforming landscapes through their dam-building activities. HertaflieÃŸ, located in Eberswalde, is a prime example of a habitat where beavers have had a significant impact on the environment.

This virtual tour allows users to explore the HertaflieÃŸ area from the comfort of their own homes, experiencing the sights and sounds of this unique ecosystem.
